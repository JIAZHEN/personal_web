<p>After finished BM in Information Management and Information System from 
	<%= link_to 'Northwest A & F University', 'http://www.nwsuaf.edu.cn/', alt: "Top 20 Universities in China" %> in July 2010, I decided to get further education in 
	<%= link_to 'The University of Birmingham', 'http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/â€Ž'%>, United Kingdom. I obained my MSc in Computer Science in Oct 2011.</p>

<p>Over the last five years of academic education and research, I've gained a strong understanding of several areas of computer science, but with particular expertise in areas of software engineering and database management.</p>

<p>I started my internship in <abbr title="The Supplies Guys">TSG</abbr> in November 2011 then became a full-time employee after three months. My main resposibilities are designing and implementing softwares, maintaining research database and integrating Google <abbr title="Paid Per Click">PPC</abbr> data into the database. I am also involved in system architecture designs and implementations.</p>

<p>Until now I have lived in UK for more than two years and had been to Delhi for three months as for a business trip. As my experience of living oversea, I strongly agree that the whold world is the same and eveyone is equal. We can be friends all over the world.
